# README for LookOut

## Introduction
LookOut is an innovative IoT wearable that leverages MultiModal AI to assist visually impaired individuals in interacting with their environment. Acting as an extra pair of 'eyes,' LookOut helps users gain better awareness and understanding of their surroundings.

## Inspiration
The idea for LookOut originated at a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) conference. A visually impaired speaker highlighted the challenges faced due to the high cost and ineffectiveness of existing technologies. Inspired to create an affordable solution using cutting-edge technology, the team from the National University of Singapore embarked on developing LookOut.

## What It Does
LookOut uses a simple mechanism: users press a button, ask a question, and the device takes a snapshot of the environment. This image is analyzed using MultiModal AI, and a spoken response is generated, providing detailed insights based on the visual data.

## How We Built It
LookOut was developed using various state-of-the-art models for image interpretation, including OpenAI's GPT 4 Vision for processing visual data. Whisper was used for text-to-speech and speech-to-text functions. The system, designed for efficiency, employs parallelization and multithreading. It uses various Python libraries for integrating hardware components like camera and microphone on a Raspberry Pi.

## Challenges We Ran Into
The project faced significant hardware challenges, including shortages and compatibility issues. Solutions involved using borrowed and old hardware components and leveraging legacy libraries.

## Accomplishments
Despite various obstacles, the team is proud of staying true to their vision and overcoming technical difficulties. The experience has provided valuable knowledge for future endeavors.

## Future Plans
The goal is to refine LookOut, making it more user-friendly and indispensable for visually impaired users. Continual improvements are planned to meet the computational needs of the project.
